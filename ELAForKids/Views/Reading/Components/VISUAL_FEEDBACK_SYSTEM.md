# Visual Feedback System Documentation

## Overview

The Visual Feedback System provides comprehensive visual cues and interactive elements to help elementary school children understand their reading mistakes and improve their pronunciation. The system is designed to be child-friendly, educational, and encouraging.

## Core Components

### 1. TextHighlightView

**Purpose**: Displays text with color-coded highlighting to show correct words and different types of mistakes.

**Features**:
- **Word-by-word highlighting** with different colors for different mistake types
- **Interactive word tapping** to get detailed feedback
- **Adaptive grid layout** that adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Animated feedback** when mistakes are tapped
- **Legend display** explaining the color coding system

**Color Coding**:
- üü¢ **Green**: Correctly pronounced words
- üî¥ **Red**: Substitution errors (wrong word)
- üü† **Orange**: Mispronunciation errors (similar but incorrect)
- üîµ **Blue**: Omission errors (missing words)
- üü£ **Purple**: Insertion errors (extra words)

**Usage**:
```swift
TextHighlightView(
    text: "Con m√®o ng·ªìi tr√™n th·∫£m",
    mistakes: comparisonResult.mistakes,
    matchedWords: comparisonResult.matchedWords
) { word, index in
    // Handle word tap
    playCorrectPronunciation(word)
}
```

### 2. MistakeFeedbackView

**Purpose**: Provides detailed, expandable feedback for each mistake with suggestions for improvement.

**Features**:
- **Expandable mistake cards** with detailed explanations
- **Word comparison view** showing expected vs. actual pronunciation
- **Actionable suggestions** with retry and pronunciation buttons
- **Severity indicators** (minor, moderate, major)
- **Encouraging empty state** when no mistakes are found

**Mistake Types Handled**:
- **Substitution**: "ƒê·ªçc 'm√®o' th√†nh 'ch√≥'"
- **Mispronunciation**: "Ph√°t √¢m 'th·∫£m' th√†nh 't·∫£m'"
- **Omission**: "B·ªè s√≥t t·ª´ 'ng·ªìi'"
- **Insertion**: "Th√™m t·ª´ 'nh·ªè'"

**Usage**:
```swift
MistakeFeedbackView(
    mistakes: sessionResult.mistakes,
    onRetryWord: { mistake in
        startWordRetryRecording(mistake)
    },
    onPlayCorrectPronunciation: { word in
        playTextToSpeech(word)
    }
)
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```swift
struct VisualFeedbackState {
    var showHighlighting: Bool = true
    var selectedWord: String?
    var expandedMistakes: Set<Int> = []
    var animatingElements: Set<String> = []
    var pronunciationFeedback: PronunciationFeedback?
}
```

### Animation System
- **Smooth transitions** using SwiftUI animations
- **Attention-grabbing effects** for important feedback
- **Performance-optimized** animations that don't impact usability
- **Configurable timing** for different interaction types

### Color System
```swift
enum MistakeColor {
    case correct        // Green (#4CAF50)
    case substitution   // Red (#F44336)
    case mispronunciation // Orange (#FF9800)
    case omission       // Blue (#2196F3)
    case insertion      // Purple (#9C27B0)
    
    var backgroundColor: Color { /* implementation */ }
    var borderColor: Color { /* implementation */ }
    var textColor: Color { /* implementation */ }
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Text Comparison Engine

// Provides real-time feedback during pronunciation practice
speechRecognizer.onPartialResult { partialText in
    let feedback = generateRealTimeFeedback(partialText)
    updatePronunciationFeedback(feedback)
}
```

### 3. Scoring System
```swift
// Visual feedback influences scoring and progress tracking
let visualEngagement = trackVisualFeedbackInteraction()
let adjustedScore = scoreCalculator.adjustScore(baseScore, visualEngagement)
```
